# Shortcutter
*I made this for myself before I had seen Unity's quicksearch package. Check that one out instead.*
https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.quicksearch@1.1/manual/index.html


Simple searchbar to quickly find and trigger Unity shortcuts without assigning key bindings.

Install via package manager: *Add package from git URL...* and paste the link to this repository.

Open the Shortcutter window via *Window/Shortcutter* or *Control + T* (can be changed in shortcut manager). 

It works by creating a temporary shortcut profile, binding a key to the selected shortcut, then simulating that key being pressed. Only a tiny fraction of the built in shortcuts have been tested and a lot of them are not expected to work, like 'clutch' shortcuts.
